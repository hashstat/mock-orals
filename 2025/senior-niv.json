(8) In the very same way, on the strength of their dreams\nthese ungodly people pollute their own bodies, reject authority\nand heap abuse on celestial beings. (9) But even the archangel\nMichael, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of\nMoses, did not himself dare to condemn him for slander but said,\n\"The Lord rebuke you!\" (10) Yet these people slander whatever\nthey do not understand, and the very things they do understand\nby instinct--as irrational animals do--will destroy them.
